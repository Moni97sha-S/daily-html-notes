----------------
⏹ User Interface - the look of the website (HTML & CSS)
⏹ User Experience- interaction of the website with user (JavaScript)
⏹ Back-end Development - JS with Node.js
⏹ In html tags, attributes are giving additional information to entire tag.
⏹ We always code attribute inside the opening tag.
⏹ property:text; pairs in CSS
⏹ Inline CSS Disadvantages: repeat same property-value pair for each & every tags slows down the website speed.
   > Style act as attribute
   > On highest priority condition, we use Inline CSS.
⏹ Internal CSS:
   - Style act as tag inside which we write internal CSS
   - No repetition as we call elements by tag name
   Disadvantages of Internal CSS:
   - Again slows down the run time as it reads code one line by line
   - Scrolling long codes creates chaotic for developer
⏹ External CSS:
   > link tag used to link once ur CSS file in HTML file (i.e) <link>
   > rel means relation between css & HTML is StyleSheet (i.e) rel="stylesheet"
   > type attribute informs HTML page what type of CSS file we are going to attach with HTML (i.e) type="text/css"
   > href attribute informs path of that CSS file in our system. (i.e) href="style.css"
⏹ class vary colors for particular tag among same name tags; prefer not to use - while in naming convention instead use _ or 2nd word capitalize 1st letter; called by .
⏹ id means individual identity; can't give same id repeatedly; is for single element styling; Called by #; prefer not to use - while naming instead use _ or 2nd word capitalize 1st letter

- If img is not visible to the user at that time alt is useful for user to know about what img it is
- img tag alt attribute is for alternate text on image if img url path is wrong atleast we could know img is about what
- To come out of folder in order to access img outside the html's folder use "../"


Why you should not use Google drive for assignment submissions:
Difference between google drive link & github link
- Download each file
- asset links (img) will break while using live server in google drive
- according to ur upload type like absolute or relative URL 
- u can't share ur 100% effort
- In GD, you can't update the code/folder without changing the link
