3rd May Topics
----------------
⏹ Difference between display, visibility & opacity
⏹ Aligning elements
   - using Text-align (most-commonly used)
      > if we have block element inside it inline element then use this property
   - using flex (commonly) | Go through website flexbox playground in codepen
      > when aligning multiple elements use this property.
      > can't make ur img outside of the box using this. In that case use position:relative;
      > display:flex; | always remain in center irrespective of changes in height, width
      > Responsive web-design for mobiles, tabs etc.
      > Supporting properties of flex are:
      > justify-content:right/center/left; | without this img gets left by default
      > align-items:start/center/end; | without this img gets enlarges
   - using position properties (rarely)
      > position: relative is used for parent & absolute is used for child
      > position: relative is used when img is used outside of the box container.
      > never use position:relative; for aligning items left & ri8
      > position:relative; is used only when position:absolute; is used

⏹ paragraph tag doesn't have left right margins by default. It is body's margin.

⏹ Q & A Session

2nd May Topics
----------------
⏹ CSS Comments
⏹ Cascading meaning in CSS?
   - given to same tag elements
   - Overrides
   - Whatever property repeats with different value, then the last one that is given 1st priority
⏹ Box Model [CPBM in that order]
   - content > Highlighted center 
   - padding (top, right, bottom & left ) > space between the content and border (inner-space)
   - border > between padding & margin
   - margin > space outside of the element/border (outer-space)
⏹ Display properties
   - block > Always starts with a new line & as div tag is block level element, it doesn't mean browser automatically add some space like a margin before and after the element
           > takes 100% width relative to the parent
   - Inline > takes space according to it's content
            > padding, width, height will not work properly (overlaps) for inline element
   - Inline-block > it makes overlaps in aligned manner
                  > mix of inline & blocks | padding, width & height works properly
   - flex (layout > nav, header, footer,  + align) / grid (layout)
⏹ Position properties
   - static > by default value | (Ri8 Top Bottom Left -TRBL will not work)
   - relative > relative & absolute always work together | (TRBL will work)
              > element moves from its original position
   - absolute > position is related to the parent
              > TRBL will work, element move relative to the parent (having value relative)
   - none > hide the content & remove the element space
   - fixed > position is related to the browser
           > position is fixed as top-nav bar and top button even we scroll it doesn't move
           > here TRBL works
           > element moves relative to the browser
           > if no TRBL given by default 'go to top' button will be bottom-left out of the browser
Notes: Relative is for parent & absolute is for child
       Fixed position is by default outside of the browser window

25th Apr Topics CSS tue 2nd class till fri (next 1 week) by Hiral Khakhariya
----------------
⏹ User Interface - the look of the website (HTML & CSS)
⏹ User Experience- interaction of the website with user (JavaScript)
⏹ Back-end Development - JS with Node.js
⏹ In html tags, attributes are giving additional information to entire tag.
⏹ We always code attribute inside the opening tag.
⏹ property:text; pairs in CSS
⏹ Inline CSS Disadvantages: repeat same property-value pair for each & every tags slows down the website speed.
   > Style act as attribute
   > On highest priority condition, we use Inline CSS.
⏹ Internal CSS:
   - Style act as tag inside which we write internal CSS
   - No repetition as we call elements by tag name
   Disadvantages of Internal CSS:
   - Again slows down the run time as it reads code one line by line
   - Scrolling long codes creates chaotic for developer
⏹ External CSS:
   > link tag used to link once ur CSS file in HTML file (i.e) <link>
   > rel means relation between css & HTML is StyleSheet (i.e) rel="stylesheet"
   > type attribute informs HTML page what type of CSS file we are going to attach with HTML (i.e) type="text/css"
   > href attribute informs path of that CSS file in our system. (i.e) href="style.css"
⏹ class vary colors for particular tag among same name tags; prefer not to use - while in naming convention instead use _ or 2nd word capitalize 1st letter; called by .
⏹ id means individual identity; can't give same id repeatedly; is for single element styling; Called by #; prefer not to use - while naming instead use _ or 2nd word capitalize 1st letter

- If img is not visible to the user at that time alt is useful for user to know about what img it is
- img tag alt attribute is for alternate text on image if img url path is wrong atleast we could know img is about what
- To come out of folder in order to access img outside the html's folder use "../"


Why you should not use Google drive for assignment submissions:
Difference between google drive link & github link
- Download each file
- asset links (img) will break while using live server in google drive
- according to ur upload type like absolute or relative URL 
- u can't share ur 100% effort
- In GD, you can't update the code/folder without changing the link
