‚èπ Q & A session
- If img is not visible to the user at that time alt is useful for user to know about what img it is
- img tag alt attribute is for alternate text on image if img url path is wrong atleast we could know img is about what
- To come out of folder in order to access img outside the html's folder use "../"


Why you should not use Google drive for assignment submissions:
Difference between google drive link & github link
- Download each file
- asset links (img) will break while using live server in google drive
- according to ur upload type like absolute or relative URL 
- u can't share ur 100% effort
- In GD, you can't update the code/folder without changing the link
